# Run Your Work

This code keeps your mouse curosr keep moving when you do nothing at work.
Good for people who remotely work

Used Python libraries: pyautogui, pynput

pyautogui is for moving a mouse cursor
pynput is for receiving keyboard strokes

Three key functions here
s: start
p: pause
q: quit

Once you run the script of this program
Your mouse cursor starts moving to random places in your monitor

If you hit p then it pauses
If you hit s then it starts moving
If you hit q then the program quits
