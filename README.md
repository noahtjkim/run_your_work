# Run Your Work
<br>
This code keeps your mouse curosr keep moving when you do nothing at work.
Good for people who remotely work
<br>
Used Python libraries: pyautogui, pynput
<br>
pyautogui is for moving a mouse cursor
pynput is for receiving keyboard strokes
<br>
Three key functions here <br>
s: start <br>
p: pause <br>
q: quit <br>
<br>
Once you run the script of this program
Your mouse cursor starts moving to random places in your monitor
<br>
If you hit p then it pauses
If you hit s then it starts moving
If you hit q then the program quits
